But How do You *Know*?
======================

The primary goal of this book is to teach you to think like a mathematician, and the primary thing that mathematicians think about is understanding the connections between concepts and in figuring out how to *KNOW* that they are right.

My training is actually in physics, not mathematics, though I've taken a lot of math courses, I do a lot of math in my work, and I've been teaching math classes for over 10 years.  I've also studied a lot of philosophy.  In all that training, I've learned at least three different ways of thinking about one of the fundamental questions of humanity, "How do you know?"

    contradiction
	"The sun is yellow AND the sun is NOT yellow" is a contradiction.  
	If we are speaking logically, both of those claims cannot be true
	at the same time -- they *contradict* each other.
